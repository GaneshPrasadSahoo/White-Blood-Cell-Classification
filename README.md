# 🧫 White Blood Cell Classification using Deep Learning

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that classifies **White Blood Cells (WBCs)** from microscopic images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model trained on labeled WBC data.  

It predicts cell types such as **Basophil, Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, and Neutrophil** — providing a simple and interactive interface for medical analysis.

## 🧠 Key Features
- 🩸 Classifies WBC images into five categories:
  - Basophil  
  - Eosinophil  
  - Lymphocyte  
  - Monocyte  
  - Neutrophil  
- 🧩 Built using **TensorFlow/Keras** for deep learning  
- 💻 Interactive interface powered by **Streamlit**  
- 🖼️ Real-time image upload and prediction  
- 📈 Easy-to-use web app for testing and research

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python 3.12  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Streamlit
